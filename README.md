# TrainLab
## Overview

We are developing a platform designed for budding IT
professionals. Our goal is to help beginners check and improve
their knowledge and skills. The platform provides unique opportunities
for learning and self-development. It includes tests and links to 
useful educational materials that will help users deepen their
knowledge and improve their skills.

## Technologies Used:
- React
- Redux
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- TypeScript

Project Structure:
1. Test directory: A directory where test files are stored for various professions or topics.

2. Testing module: Code responsible for providing tests to the user, executing them, and evaluating the results. 

3. User profile: A page or section where users can register, log in to the system, view their test results, save progress, and manage their profile.

4. Test selection page: An interface where users can choose tests based on specific professions to take.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation and Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your computer:
   git clone git@github.com:Train-lab-intern/frontend_dev.git

2. Install project dependencies:
   npm install

3. Run the project on a local server:
      npm start


### Deployment
https://alpha.it-roast.com/
https://trainlab.netlify.app/

### Test user for verification and registration:
logIn: test@test.com <br>
password: Test@test.com1

## Available Scripts
 
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
